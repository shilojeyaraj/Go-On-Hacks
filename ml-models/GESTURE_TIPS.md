# 🎯 Gesture Recording Tips for Best Accuracy

## The Problem
If your gestures are too similar, the model can't tell them apart!

---

## ✅ YES Gesture (Nodding)
**Motion:** VERTICAL - Up and Down

**How to do it:**
1. Start with head level, looking at camera
2. **Tilt head UP** - look at ceiling
3. **Bring head DOWN** - look at floor/chest
4. Repeat 3-5 times
5. **Keep your nose pointing forward** - don't rotate left/right

**Key:** Chin goes UP to ceiling, DOWN to chest

---

## ✅ NO Gesture (Shaking)
**Motion:** HORIZONTAL - Left and Right

**How to do it:**
1. Start with head level, looking at camera
2. **Turn head LEFT** - look at left wall/shoulder
3. **Turn head RIGHT** - look at right wall/shoulder
4. Repeat 3-5 times
5. **Keep chin level** - don't move up or down

**Key:** Nose points LEFT wall, then RIGHT wall

---

## ✅ NEUTRAL Gesture (Still)
**Motion:** NONE - Stay Still

**How to do it:**
1. Look directly at camera
2. Stay completely still
3. Natural facial expression
4. Minimal blinking is OK
5. No head movement at all

**Key:** Like taking a photo - freeze

## 🎯 Critical Differences

| Gesture | Primary Axis | Face Movement | What Moves |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| YES | Vertical (Y) | Up ↑ Down ↓ | Chin up/down |
| NO | Horizontal (X) | Left ← Right → | Nose left/right |
| NEUTRAL | None | Still | Nothing |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ BAD YES Gesture:
- Moving head in circles
- Tilting head side-to-side
- Too subtle - model can't see it
- Mixing with horizontal movement

### ❌ BAD NO Gesture:
- Tilting head (YES motion) while turning
- Diagonal movement (mixing YES and NO)
- Too fast - causes blur
- Too subtle - head barely moves

### ❌ BAD NEUTRAL:
- Small fidgeting movements
- Slight nodding or shaking
- Looking around
- Extracted from gesture videos (might contain gesture)

## 🎬 Recording Strategy

### For Maximum Accuracy:

**Record 15 videos per gesture:**

1. **5 Normal videos** - Regular pace, medium intensity
2. **5 Exaggerated videos** - Slow, LARGE movements
3. **5 Subtle videos** - Faster, smaller movements

**Mix these conditions:**
- Different starting positions
- Different speeds (slow, medium, fast)
- Different intensities (small, medium, large)
- Different facial expressions (neutral, smiling)
- Different lighting (if possible)

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### YES Gesture:
- Imagine you're saying "yes, absolutely!"
- Look at ceiling, then at your feet
- Exaggerate the up/down motion
- Keep face forward (don't turn left/right)

### NO Gesture:
- Imagine you're saying "no way!"
- Look at your left shoulder, then right shoulder
- Exaggerate the left/right turn
- Keep chin level (don't move up/down)

### NEUTRAL:
- Imagine you're waiting for someone to speak
- Stay completely still
- Natural, relaxed face
- Like a statue for 10 seconds

## 📊 Testing Your Gestures

Before recording, test yourself:

1. **Record a test video** of each gesture
2. **Play it back** - can YOU clearly tell which gesture it is?
3. **If you can't tell** - it needs to be more exaggerated
4. **If it looks mixed** (like YES + NO) - do it over

---

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

**Make each gesture SO DIFFERENT that a child could tell them apart!**

If your YES and NO look similar, the model will be confused too.
